## About

## Development

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Data
On the first usage of a GDrive remote, for example when trying to dvc push tracked data for the first time, DVC will prompt you to visit a special Google authentication web page. There you'll need to sign into a Google account with the needed access to the GDrive URL in question.
